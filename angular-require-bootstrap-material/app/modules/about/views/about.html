            Important information about your speed estimate
			We estimate your future broadband speed based on several factors including the length of your telephone line to the exchange and the speed of similar lines in your area. Please note that the actual speed you will get might be higher, or lower, depending on the quality of your individual telephone line and the time of day you are using the internet.

			We've signed up to Ofcom's broadband speeds voluntary code of practice and we'll always give you the fastest speed your line can handle. We've estimated your line speed based on the actual speeds measured on our broadband services.

			We'll do everything we can to try and give you a great experience online but the speed you experience is likely to be affected by certain things outside of our control like the distance your home is from the telephone exchange, the specification of your PC and the condition of the wiring in your home. You may also notice a drop in your speeds during peak times in the evening and at weekends when more people are using the Internet.
